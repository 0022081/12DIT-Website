                    <p>At the age of 6 I took to sailing at my local sailing club which was literally at the bottom of my garden in England. From that day I was hooked on boats, I sailed neraly every weekend until the age of 19.</p>
                    <p>After a brief spell in the Navy, I was inspired one day by paintings by the Cornish school, depicting traditional fishing boats of the British Isles, and of the men who built, sailed, rowed and fished in these working boats.</p>
                    <p>I was taken by how these boats were made and fitted out using simple methods of construction yet had to be sturdy enough to take the heavy North Sea storms. I appreciated how each boats was unique to a particular area and the building traditions of socitey that produced them.</p>
                    <p>I first started to make replicas in my living room as I was tenting and needed money to pay for my college fees. I decided to go to Lowestof college, at the ripe old age of 30 undertaking Boat building and Yacht construction, nedless to say I opted to construct a traditional clinker boat, a West Mersea 10ft dinghy. this I bough over with me and I still sail on occasion.</p>
                    <p>My library of material includes plans photos and rare books collected over many years. This had enabled me to contruct over 30 replica boats from essex smacks to Arthur Ransom's Swallow and Amazon, most now are in private collections and one in a bank in the U.K.</p>
                    <p>All replicas are unique and hand built using in some cases the same methods of construction as the full size versions. I have taught myself many of the disappearing skills required to reconstruct a boat in authentic detail, from fishing boats arriving to its home port after weeks at sea, to a brand new open rowing boat straight out of the boat builders shed.</p>
